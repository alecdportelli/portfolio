                Background 
            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                With AI becoming a bigger part of government engineering systems, there is an urgent need to 
                test the security of trained models. 
            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                Many parts of those systems are powered by reinforcement learning models, many in which are susceptible 
                to adverserial attacks. 
            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                Being able to train a model and then attack it to see where
                its weaknesses are gives a lot of crucial information needed to build safe autonomous systems. That
                is where AI SAFARI comes in.

                The Project
            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                AI SAFARI stands for: AI Simulation for Assurance Foundations and Robust Intelligence. The goal is to 
                understand weak points of a trained policy and discover adverserial attack vectors.

            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                AI SAFARI provides the frameworks needed to train a policy, attack it, and collect the data needed 
                to evaluate the performance.

                Recreating OpenAI's Moon Lander
            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                To start building this capability, the team had to decide a scenario to build around. 
            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                Many of the common scenarios in the RL community, such as cartpole or taxi, are far too simple 
                to demonstrate to a government sponsor. The scenario has to be more realistic than a cartoon drawing
                and needs to be government related. 
            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                The team chose to use OpenAI's moon lander because there is a lot of resources available to 
                help us easily implement it into the framework. 
            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                It is also a government related topic that allows for a ton of experimentation.

                There are two main components of this project: the simulation environment needed to train policies
                and the evaluation toolkit. 
            </div>
            <div className='body-par'>
                My role primarily focused on the simulation environments. However, I put a lot of work into building
                the pipelines to to the evaluation toolkit.
